# cuny-mc-stock-market-data-analysis
in this project, me and my teammates looked at the tickers for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. we used Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to extract the data from Yahoo for analysis and visualization purposes. we found the highs, lows, open, and closing prices, and volume for each company then plotted their 1-year trend wit a graph. we also found each of their daily returns. one insight that was very interesting was that the daily returns were roughly the same across all four companies. another aspect we measured was the risk-to-expected returns ratio and noticed AAPL was the highest while GOOG was the lowest.
